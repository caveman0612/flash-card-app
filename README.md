# Trello Clone

## Overview

This project allows the user to make decks and have flip cards in each deck. There is a function that allows the user to go into study mode which hides the back of the card. 

## Technologies

This project is built on React with javascript. 

## Going Forward

Going forward I am going to build my own back end since we only built the front-end and I want to make this my own personal full stack project
